This program conatins the blueprint to configure the Arduino Mega board and the WiFly GX Breakout board (WiFLY RN-131C) to act as a client which connects to an adHoc wirless network, which has been generated by the server WiFly Board.

This program also disables the use of DHCP and allocates a static IP address. Now as we know the IP address of the server WiFly board, we can configure the sending of the data.


This program then sends the data to the other WiFly board, aka the server WiFly board.
