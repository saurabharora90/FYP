This project contains the code for opening a socket and connecting to the parrot AR DRONE and then send commands to it over WIFI.

You need to connect the Drone wifi's before using this program to send commands to it. Only a few AT Commands have been programmed as this is only for testing purposes.

The drone's IP is "192.168.1.1" and it listens on UDP_PORT	5556
